Quickstart
==========

The first thing you have to do in order to get started with skink is to download one of it's releases. For now we only support source code releasing.

Grabbing the Code
-----------------

In order to get the code, you need to have Git installed. There are several tutorials on the web that teach how to install git, so we'll skip that.

After git is installed just clone skink from `git@github.com:heynemann/skink.git <git@github.com:heynemann/skink.git>`_ and you are good to go::

    git clone git@github.com:heynemann/skink.git
